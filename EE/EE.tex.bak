\item CE655 are kept with normal font, while \texttt{our CE615 questions are kept in this style}.
\item 2069 Poush QP has no marking given for any questions. Any and all markings given for 2069 Poush in this document are assumed that will hopefully reflect the actual markings.
\item The question paper for 67 Mangsir and earlier are of different course. So, there will be inherently different kinds of questions being asked.
