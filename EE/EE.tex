			\item Find the economic service life of a new electric lift truck which costs \$ 20,000, have a operating cost of \$ 1000 in the first year and have salvage value of \$ 12,000 at the end of the first year. For the remaining years,  operating costs increase each by 10\% over the previous years operating costs. Similarly the salvage value declines each year by 20\% from the previous years salvage value. The lift truck has a maximum life of 7 years. An overhaul costing of \$ 3000 and \$ 5000 will be required during the fifth and seventh year of service respectively. The firm's required rate of return is 15\% per year. \hfill [10] (\bo{69 Bh})

			\item A firm has a contract to provide printing service to IOE for next 8 years. It can provide the service using its old printing machine (the current defender) or the newly brought machine (the challenger). After the contract work neither the old machine nor the new machine will be ratined. Considering the annual equivalent costs of the old machine and new machine as follows, what are their economic service life? And what is the best replacement strategy? \hfill [10] (\bo{69 Bh})

				\item Find the economic service life of ``Chevrolet Spark 1.0 LT" car which costs Rs. 19,00,000 at first and running since 2012 AD (end). The owner of the car wants to know the economic service life of his car for replacement purpose. He finds out the average mileage of 12km/litre and average daily run of vehicle is 25km throughout 320 days running in a year for the first year then after average operation cost of vehicle increases by Rs. 20,00,000 every year. An average cost of petrol per liter can be assumed to be Rs. 170. The annual maintenance cost for the first year is Rs. 45,000 and increases by 15\% per year then after. Market value of the car will be decreased by 20\% annually in last year's value. Is this year 2024 a replacement year for him? Take MARR = 12\%.

				\item An existing asset that cost \$ 16,000 two years ago has a market value of \$ 12,000 today, an expected salvage value of \$ 2,000 at the end of its remaining useful life of six more years, and annual operating costs of \$ 4,000. A new asset under consideration as a replacement has an initial cost of \$ 10,000, an expected salvage value of \$ 4,000 at the end of its economic life of three years, and annual operating costs of \$ 2,000. It is assumed that this new asset could be replaced by another one identical in every respect after three years at a salvage value of \$ 4,000, if desired. Use an MARR of 11\%, a six-year study period, and PW calculations to decide whether the existing asset should be replaced by the new one. \hfill [8] (\texttt{81 Ba})

				\item A company is contemplating replacing a machine having a current market value of Rs. 9,000 which decreases each year by Rs. 1500 per year. Its operating cost is Rs. 3000 for the first year and increases each year by 800 Rs per year for 5 years. The company will have to pay Rs. 18,000 for the new machine and its market value decreases by 20\% per year over the previous year for five years. The new machine needs Rs 1500 for operation in the first year and this cost increases by 25\% each year. Find the annual equivalent cost of both the machines and compute the best replacement strategy if the machine is needed for 5 years. \hfill [5+5] (\texttt{80 Ba})

				\item A company is considering the replacement of old machine. If the machine is repaired, it can be used for 5 more years. It can be sold to the other firm is Rs 5000. If the machine is kept it will require an immediate overhaul (renovation) of Rs 1200 to make it operable condition. Overhaul charge is not extended for service life. The operation cost is estimated at Rs 2000 during the first year and these are expected to increase by Rs. 1500 per year thereafter. Further market values are expected to decline by Rs 1000 per year. The new machine cost Rs. 10,000 and will have operating costs of Rs. 2000 in the first year, increasing Rs. 800 per year thereafter. Salvage value is Rs 6000 after one year and will decline by 15\% each year. The company requires a rate of return of 15\%. Determine economic life of each option and when the defender should be replaced?
